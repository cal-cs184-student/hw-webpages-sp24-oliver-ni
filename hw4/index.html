<h1 id="homework-4-cloth-simulation">Homework 4: Cloth Simulation</h1>
<p>In this project, we implemented a simple simulation for cloth
material. There are many ways to simulate cloth, but we used the
simplest method, which is modeling the cloth as a grid of masses
connected by springs. The springs provide the forces that keep the cloth
together and give it its shape.</p>
<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<p>First, we built the actual grid of masses and springs that represent
the cloth. There are a few different types of springs in the
simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural springs that connect each mass to its neighbors in the
grid. These primarily keep the cloth from falling apart.</li>
<li>Shearing springs that connect each mass to its diagonal neighbors.
These help the cloth maintain its shape when it is stretched.</li>
<li>Bending springs that connect each mass to its second-nearest
neighbors. These help the cloth maintain its shape when it is bent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s pictures the cloth grid, with each of these types of springs
enabled:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 32%" />
<col style="width: 31%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Structural</th>
<th>Shearing</th>
<th>Bending</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="part1/structural.png" /></td>
<td><img src="part1/shearing.png" /></td>
<td><img src="part1/bending.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that the structural and bending screenshots look the same in
the screenshot, since the perfect grid makes it impossible to
differentiate between lines between nearest neighbors and lines between
second-nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>With them all enabled, the cloth looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="part1/all.png" /></p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Next, we implemented the physics simulation that actually moves the
cloth. We first calculate the forces on each mass, based on both
external accelerations on the whole cloth (in this case, gravity) as
well as the forces from the springs connecting the masses. To do this,
we use Hooke’s Law as well as <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em> = <em>m</em><em>a</em></span> to
calculate the forces on each mass.</p>
<p>Once we have the forces, we can calculate the movement of the cloth.
Because we only know what the accelerations of the masses should be, and
the velocities aren’t constant, we need a way to approximate the
integral. To do this, we used the Verlet integration method.</p>
<p>There are a couple parameters of the cloth in our simulation: the
spring constant <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, tdamping
constant <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, as well as the
density of the point masses in the cloth. Playing around with these, we
notice the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The spring constant <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> affects the
“strechiness” of the cloth (along the plane). Although the way the cloth
falls is pretty similar regardless of the value of <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, the
resulting shape of the cloth is different. Low values of <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> make the
cloth “sag” down more, while high values of <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> make the
cloth more taut.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="part2/ks-5000.png" /></td>
<td><img src="part2/ks-50000.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p>The density affects the “rigidity” the cloth (with respect to
bends). Higher densities make the cloth more “solid” and less likely to
bend or fold, whilea lower densities make the cloth more flexible. This
is because the density affects the mass of each point mass in the cloth,
and thus how much force is needed to move it.</p>

</table></li>
<li><p>The damping factor <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>
affects the “bounciness” of the cloth. Low values of <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> make the cloth feel more bouncy,
where even after falling, it will continue to bounce back and force,
losing little energy. High values of <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> make the cloth come to rest more
quickly after stabilizing (though it makes it fall slower).</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the cloth in <code>final.json</code> in its
final resting state:</p>

<h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>
<p>We also implemented a simple collision detection system to prevent
the cloth from falling through the ground, or through spheres. For each
of these cases, we find where the point would have intersected the
object, calculate the adjustment vector it would have taken to get to
that position, and add that to its previous position, multiplying by a
friction factor.</p>
<p>Here’s pictures of the cloth falling onto a sphere, with different
<span class="math inline"><em>k</em><em>s</em></span> values:</p>

<p>Additionally, here is a picture of the cloth lying onto a plane:</p>
<p><img src="part3/plane.png" /></p>
<h2 id="part-4">Part 4</h2>
<p>In this part, we implemented self-collision detection to prevent the
cloth from intersecting itself. In order to accelerate this process, we
implemented spatial hashing to quickly find nearby candidate points to
check for collisions. This is done by dividing the space into smaller 3D
blocks, and then checking only the points that are in the same block as
the point in question.</p>
<p>Here’s pictures of the cloth starting to fall onto itself:</p>

<p>Here’s pictures of the cloth’s resting position after falling and

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that the higher density allows for more folds and smaller
folds to take place, and the higher spring constant makes the cloth more
taut, as we described in Part 2.</p>
<h2 id="part-5">Part 5</h2>
<p>In this part, we implemented shaders for the cloth to make it look
more realistic. We wrote shaders for OpenGL using GLSL. These shaders
consist of two parts, a vertex shader and a fragment shader. The vertex
shader is responsible for transforming the vertices of the cloth, and
then passes that info into the fragment shader, which is responsible for
coloring the pixels of the cloth.</p>
<p>First, we implemented Diffuse and Blinn-Phong shading. In particular,
the way the Blinn-Phong reflection model works is by computing three
components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambient: constant based on the ambient light in the scene.</li>
<li>Diffuse: where light reflects at the same angle as it hits the
surface. Creates a matte look.</li>
<li>Specular: where light reflects at the angle of reflection, creating
a shiny look.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components are weighted together to create the final color of
the pixel. Here’s some screenshots comparing the different
components:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 32%" />
<col style="width: 32%" />
<col style="width: 34%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Ambient</th>
<th>Diffuse</th>
<th>Specular</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="part5/phong-ambient.png" /></td>
<td><img src="part5/phong-diffuse.png" /></td>
<td><img src="part5/phong-specular.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here’s a picture of the cloth with the full Phong shading:</p>
<p><img src="part5/phong.png" /></p>
<p>We also implemented texture mapping, which is a way to apply a
texture to the 3D model. This is done by mapping the texture coordinates
of the 3D model to the texture, and then using those coordinates to
color the pixel. Here’s a picture of the cloth with a texture:</p>
<p><img src="part5/texture.png" /></p>
<p>In order to make the cloth look more realistic, we also implemented
bump and displacement mapping. Bump mapping is a technique to simulate
bumps and dents on a surface, without actually changing the geometry of
the object. This is done by messing with the normal of the surface at
each pixel, and then using that normal to calculate the lighting.
Displacement mapping is similar, but actually changes the geometry of
the object.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Bump Mapping</th>
<th>Displacement Mapping</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="part5/bump.png" /></td>
<td><img src="part5/displacement.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice how the cloth rendered in the bump mapping is still entirely
smooth on the edges of the sphere, while the cloth rendered in the
displacement mapping has actual bumps and dents.</p>
<p>Lastly, we implemented mirror reflection. This is done by simply
reflecting the ray at the point of intersection, at exactly the same
angle as it hit the surface. Then, we can follow that ray and map the
texture at that point.</p>
